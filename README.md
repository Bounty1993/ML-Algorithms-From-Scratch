**Machine Learning from Scratch**

The purpose of the project is to show most popular
machine learning algorithms. Implementation is quite basic. 

Libraries used:
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib

*Note: If you want to use machine learning algorithms for 
prediction and analysis big data you should use sklearn or other 
machine learning libraries. Algorithms in this module are just for
educational purpose. They should not be use in production.*
