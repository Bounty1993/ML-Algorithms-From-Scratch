**Machine Learning from Scratch**

The purpose of the project is to show most popular
machine learning algorithms. Implementation is quite basic. 

Libraries used:
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib


Current models:
1. linear_models.py:
    * Linear Regression
    * Ridge Regression
    * Stochastic Gradient Descent
2. Logisting Regression
3. Naive Bayes Classifier
4. AdaBoosting
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest

*Note: If you want to use machine learning algorithms for 
prediction and analysis big data you should use sklearn or other 
machine learning libraries. Algorithms in this module are just for
educational purpose. They should not be use in production.*
